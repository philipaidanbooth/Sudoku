# Sudoku

In this project from Colby's data structures and algorithm's class, I created a sudoku solver in java. The project challenged our ability with the particular data structure of a stack implemented linked list, which we coded ourselves. 

Running the Sudoku.java file will prompt a user to input the number of locked sudoku squares followed by the dimensions. Then, my program will attempt to solve the game using a depth-first search backtracking strategy. 

Here is the link to an additional report I made in google docs:
